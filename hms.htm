            <h2>Hospital Management System</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <P>This is an online Hospital Management Platform made by priyanka gouda and my team as the final year BCA
                Project of Hinjilicut Autonomous college. The web site was design to give a
                easy service to direct contact with Hospital and doctor at any Moment. <br><br>
                Hospitals play a major role in a human's life. There is no human on earth that is not going to be
                suffering some sort of sickness. I
                have listed more than 90 Computer Science Projects for Final Year. Check that. It is a very harsh but
                the truth of life. Nothing is perfect
                on this earth so does a human. Hospitals provide the best medical facility to people who are not well.
            <h2 style="color: white;">How can It Help?</h2>
            <p>There are several other reasons that a person needs medical assistance. And, to provide the best medical
                assistance, the
                management of the hospital must be disciplined, well-versed in its service-providing techniques. They
                should be able to keep track
                of the records of the doctors, patients, nurses, and other hospital statt, But if these records are
                maintained on paper, it is not very efficient, is not reliable and is a very time consuming Process. In
                today's highly technological era, it is not feasible not also technically but also economically.</p>
